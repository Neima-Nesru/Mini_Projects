# React Projects

This repository contains two small applications developed using ReactJS: a food ordering app and an expense tracker app.

## 1. Food Ordering App

The food ordering app allows users to browse through a list of available food items, select the desired items, and place an order. Users can also add items to their cart, update quantities, and remove items if necessary. The app provides a clean and user-friendly interface for a seamless food ordering experience.

## 2. Expense Tracker App

The expense tracker app helps users keep track of their expenses. Users can add details of their expenses such as amount, category, and date. The app then presents a visually appealing dashboard that showcases expenditure patterns through charts. This aids users in effectively managing their finances and making informed decisions.

Both apps are built using ReactJS, providing an interactive and responsive user interface. The apps are easy to navigate and designed with a focus on usability.
