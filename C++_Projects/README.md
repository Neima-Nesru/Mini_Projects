# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a mini project developed using C++. It is designed to manage the day-to-day functioning of a library, such as book cataloging, book lending, and book return processes.

## Features

- Book Cataloging: The system allows librarians to add, update, and delete books from the library catalog. Each book entry includes its title, author, ISBN, and availability status.

- Book Lending: Librarians can issue books to library members upon request. The system keeps track of the borrower's information, issue date, and due date.

- Book Returns: When a member returns a book, the system updates its availability status and removes the associated borrower information.

- Search Functionality: Users can search for books in the library using title, author, or ISBN. The system provides instant results with book details and availability status.

## Installation

To use the Library Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project files from the repository.
2. Open the project in a C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Dev-C++ or Visual Studio.
3. Build and compile the project to generate the executable file.
4. Run the executable file to launch the Library Management System.

## Usage

Once the Library Management System is running, you can perform various actions:

- Add a new book: Select the "Add Book" option and provide the required details.
- Delete a book: Select the "Delete Book" option and specify the book's ISBN to remove it from the library.
- Issue a book to a member: Choose the "Issue Book" option and enter the member and book details to complete the issue process.
- Return a book: Select the "Return Book" option and provide the book's ISBN. The system updates the availability status and removes the associated borrower information.
- Search for books: Use the "Search" option and enter keywords related to a book's title, author, or ISBN to retrieve matching results.

## Future Enhancements

The Library Management System can be enhanced further with the following features:

- User authentication: Implement a login system to restrict access to authorized librarians.
- Notifications: Send automated notifications to members for book due dates and reservation availability.
- Reporting and statistics: Generate reports on frequently borrowed books, members' borrowing history, and other useful statistics.
